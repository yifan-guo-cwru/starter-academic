Yifan Guo is a Research Assistant at Case Western Reserve University. Before joining CWRU, he received the B.S. degree in information and computing sciences from the Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China, in 2013, and the M.S. degree in computer science from Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, USA, in 2015.Â 

His research interests focus on security and privacy issues and optimization algorithm designs in intelligent learning systems with an emphasis on anomaly detection, adversarial training, and robust federated learning, and their applications on the Internet of Things (IoT), Cyber-physical Systems (CPS), computer vision, smart city, and smart health, etc.  

His current research goal is to investigate the intercorrelation between security and practical deep learning systems in two folds: 1) developing efficient, scalable, and implementable deep learning schemes for security applications in IoT systems; 2) investigating the vulnerability of practical deep learning systems, and ultimately, developing robust defense strategies to address the security and privacy concerns in both distributed and decentralized settings.
